## **Hello and welcome to my website!**
<br />
<font size="4.5"> I am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University. I am on the Job Market for the 2022-2023 academic year. 

<br />

I am an applied macroeconomist with particular interests in Monetary and Financial Economics.

<br />

I have been working on several interrelated projects, focusing on <br>1) the identification and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy shocks; <br>2) the relationship between house prices and monetary policy; and <br>3) regional heterogeneity in real house price dynamics. </font>
