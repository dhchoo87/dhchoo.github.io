- <a> <font size="4"> **The effects of unanticipated monetary policy on real house prices (2023)** </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: A measure of high-frequency monetary policy shocks is an important tool for identifying the effects of policy surprises on real house prices. This paper documents that high-frequency changes in market rates around FOMC announcements can be explained multi-dimensional way; Surprise changes in the federal funds rate, forward guidance, and large-scale asset purchases. Real house prices respond strongly to the surprises to longer-term future rates as compared to the surprise changes in the federal funds rate. These findings are established using panel data in the United States between 1991 and 2018 across divisions. The responsiveness of house prices to monetary policy shocks depends on the nature of the shock - expansionary versus contractionary. The paper documents that contractionary monetary policy shocks have a considerably greater and more persistent impact on real house prices.

- <a> <font size="4"> **The role of macro-policies in regional real house price dynamics (2023)**  </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: This paper utilizes a multi-level dynamic factor model estimated on quarterly state-level data from 1976 to 2022 using Bayesian methods to estimate the relative importance of the national component in real house price movements compared to local shocks. The paper provides evidence that regional components account for an average of 48\% of the variation in real house price dynamics from 1976 to the late 1990s, indicating a significant role played by regional and state-specific (local) factors during this period. However, in contrast, a national factor contributes to a substantial portion of real house price fluctuations in recent periods, with an average of 87\% for 2007-2011 and 85\% for 2020-2022.

- <a href="ID_MP_HP.pdf#" class="download" title="Download as PDF"> <font size="4"> **Does the Federal Reserve respond to house prices? Implications for monetary policy (2023)**  </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: This paper revisits Romer and Romer's (2004) narrative identification approach to monetary policy shocks by allowing a monetary authority to respond systematically to corporate credit spreads and real house price dynamics. The paper documents the systematic response of interest rates to these variables and shows that accounting for this systematic response solves an observed empirical puzzle in the literature, where unanticipated increases in the interest rate, instead of contracting the economy, acted as expansionary shocks during the Great Moderation period. Specifically, it investigates the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts using natural language processing tools, to document the increased importance of house prices in discussions among FOMC members about the implementation of monetary policy. </font>

- <a> <font size="4"> **Necessity of managing non-core liabilities: Evidence from commercial banks in South Korea** </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="4"> **Abstract**: The paper constructs panel data using the balance sheets of 15 domestic banks and studies the relevance of non-core liabilities relative to the bank assets on the default risk. The banks resort to non-core liabilities to meet the excess credit demand when there is faster credit growth than deposits. However, the relative size of the non-core liabilities can increase banksâ€™ risk exposure. Hence, once a contractionary shock hits the economy, especially the financial markets, refinancing to maturity would be limited, leading to serious liquidity risk and a credit crunch. According to the panel analysis, this paper provides empirical evidence that the default risk increases as banks use non- core liabilities for their primary financing purposes.
