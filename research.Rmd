    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: This paper revisits Romer and Romer's (2004) narrative identification approach to monetary policy shocks by allowing the monetary authority to respond systematically to corporate credit spreads and real house price dynamics. The paper documents the systematic response of interest rates to these variables and shows that accounting for this systematic response solves the observed empirical puzzle in the literature where unanticipated increases in the interest rate, instead of contracting the economy, act as expansionary shocks during the Great Moderation period. The paper further investigates the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) transcripts using natural language processing tools to document the increased importance of house prices in the discussions of the FOMC members for the implementation of monetary policy. </font> <br />

- <a> <font size="4"> **Non-linear effects of monetary policy on the housing market** </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: Since the great financial crisis from mid-2007 to early 2009 and the short but steep COVID-19 recession, the housing sector has gained growing attention in the macroeconomic literature. Despite much debate has been about the relationship between monetary policy and housing prices and the ability of the policy to affect the prices; still, the literature has primarily focused on its aggregate linear impact on house prices. This paper examines the non-linearities of monetary policy on house prices. The paper documents that a reduction in the interest rate is less effective in stimulating real house prices than an interest rate increase is in dampening the prices. Where the intersection of demand and supply determines house prices in a given area, the supply curve is piecewise linear and kinked: only if the price exceeds the fixed cost of construction will supply increase. This paper aims to investigate this model's empirical relevance and suggest that monetary tightening has a greater contractionary effect on aggregate house prices than monetary accommodation in either area with an inelastic housing supply or elastic housing supply.

- <a> <font size="4"> **Regional heterogeneity in house price dynamics and the role of monetary policy**  </font> </a> <br />

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: This paper examines (I) whether the heterogeneous variation in house prices dynamics across the states in the U.S. reflects a national phenomenon or rather a regional-specific component in the local housing market, aiming to revisit the work of Del Negro and Otrok (2007), based on expanded data covering for the Covid-19 period from 1975 to 2021; (II) the extent to which monetary policy shocks can explain the variation in national factor of house prices over the sample period; and (III) assess the role of fundamentals such as population growth, land prices, and regulatory strictness to examine the heterogeneous variation across the region in the U.S. housing market. The paper provides empirical evidence that the estimated national factor accounts for a sizeable portion of the variation over 2001-2012 in terms of the variance of house price movement 35%. Further, monetary tightening has a contractionary effect on the national factor of house prices, though the innovation explains less than 3% variation in the factor. In addition, in the wake of the Covid-19 era, the national component explains most of the variation in the housing cycle; it accounts for 57% of variation in the housing market.

    <font size="3"> **Abstract**: The paper constructs panel data using the balance sheets of 15 domestic banks and studies the relevance of non-core liabilities relative to the bank assets on the default risk. The banks resort to non-core liabilities to meet the excess credit demand when there is faster credit growth than deposits. However, the relative size of the non-core liabilities can increase banksâ€™ risk exposure. Hence, once a contractionary shock hits the economy, especially the financial markets, refinancing to maturity would be limited, leading to serious liquidity risk and a credit crunch. According to the panel analysis, this paper provides empirical evidence that the default risk increases as banks use non- core liabilities for their primary financing purposes.
